# Kitchen Bravery
This is a program for Windows and Linux to create random recepies. It's meant to have 3 Modes: completely random, random with parameters and what food have I lying around. The Advice that not all of the recepies are tasty is meant serious here.

# Future
This program doesn't work currently so don't expect anything from it. It will be written in Java and doesn't support MacOS natively.
The author of the program also doesn't want to support it in the foreseeable future, due to the prices and the ecosystem of Apple Inc.

## Modes
### Completely random
This mode is made for people, who like to randomize their food and their day. Keep in mind that the recepies made by this mode can be
very long. Because it will take the amount of ingredients in it's Database as the maximium.
### Random with Parameters
This mode is the standard mode. You can either adjust those parameters like amount of ingredients or number of steps or take the preset
of maximum 10 ingredients with a maximum of 5 steps.
### What have I lying around?
That mode is meant for people, who don't want to go shopping or can't go shopping. So the algorithm gives you something to do with 
your food.
### Minor Modes
There are two minor modes planned: vegan and vegetarian. It is really self explainatory, so I don't go in any further detail here.

## Taste
I don't take any legal responsibility for the recepies, that this program produces nor do I say, that
it is a good idea to cook these, but it can be a really good recepie, that no one has every made. So you can be the first one (I dn't know if that's good
to be sure).

## Things you might want to do
